      <p> My main objective is growth; I strive to consistently improve upon my foundation. As an intern, I look forward to exposure to real-life work problems with a team. I want to delve into details/patterns in development to further my understanding and refine my problem-solving skills as I learn from and observe those around me. As I deepen and expand my analytical thinking, I will be better able to express ideas and concepts to my team and assert my opinions. I want to gain enough understanding to confidently offer tangible solutions to a problem. As my proficiency progresses, I will be able to take initiative, approach problems more independently, and eventually hope to take on increased responsibility.  </p>
      <p> My personal coding journey began in a less orthodox manner than most. At first, I enjoyed coding as a hobby that pushed the limits of my curiosity and critical thinking. Around the time I began learning to code, I was feeling restless at my job and found myself coveting mental stimulation/development above all else. I left to pursue a career that would afford me exactly that. Coding is exciting in that itâ€™s versatile and limitless; you can mold it as you choose and dictate your direction. Limitless opportunity === limitless growth, which is what attracts me to software engineering.</p>
      <p> I'd like to create software that makes a social impact. Technology can be used to help certain 
        overlooked and underprivileged communities gain access to valuable knowledge and resources. 
        It would be fulfilling to be able to give back to and empower my community whether it be through voting access, healthcare, etc. </p>
